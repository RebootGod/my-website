# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

**Noobz Cinema** is a Laravel 12.x movie and TV series streaming platform with TMDB integration, user management, and comprehensive admin functionality. The application uses a hierarchical role system and provides both movie and series content with search capabilities.

## Development Commands

### Local Development
```bash
# Start development environment (runs server, queue, logs, and vite concurrently)
composer run dev

# Alternative individual commands
php artisan serve                    # Start Laravel server
npm run dev                         # Start Vite development server
php artisan queue:listen --tries=1  # Start queue worker
php artisan pail --timeout=0       # Start real-time logs
```

### Database Management
```bash
php artisan migrate                 # Run migrations
php artisan migrate:fresh --seed    # Fresh migration with seeders
php artisan db:seed                 # Run seeders only
```

### Testing and Code Quality
```bash
composer run test                   # Run PHPUnit tests (clears config first)
php artisan test                    # Direct test command
./vendor/bin/pint                   # Run Laravel Pint code formatter
```

### Asset Building
```bash
npm run build                       # Build production assets
npm run dev                         # Development asset compilation
```

### Cache and Optimization
```bash
php artisan config:clear            # Clear configuration cache
php artisan route:clear             # Clear route cache
php artisan view:clear              # Clear view cache
php artisan optimize:clear          # Clear all caches
```

## Architecture Overview

### Core Business Logic Structure

**Service Layer Architecture**: The application uses a service-oriented architecture separating business logic from controllers:

- `TMDBService.php` - Handles all TMDB API interactions with smart search detection
- `MovieService.php` - Core movie business logic and operations
- `AnalyticsService.php` - User analytics and tracking functionality
- `InviteCodeService.php` - Invitation system management
- `MovieFilterService.php` - Advanced filtering and search logic

### User Management System

**Hierarchical Role System**: Implements a complex permission structure with role inheritance:

- **Roles**: `super_admin` → `admin` → `moderator` → `member` → `guest`
- **Permission Check**: Uses `canManage()` methods for hierarchical access control
- **User Model**: Includes password rehashing security and comprehensive relationship definitions

### Content Management

**Dual Content System**: Supports both movies and TV series with shared functionality:

- **Movies**: Full TMDB integration with genres, sources, and quality management
- **Series**: Season/episode structure with individual episode tracking
- **Shared Features**: Search, genres, user views, watchlists, and ratings

### TMDB Integration

**Dual TMDB Services**: Two TMDB service implementations for different API versions:

- `TMDBService.php` - Primary service with smart ID vs title detection
- `NewTMDBService.php` - Alternative implementation for specific use cases
- **API Caching**: Currently not implemented but planned for performance optimization

### Admin Panel Structure

**Modular Admin Controllers**: Separated by functionality for maintainability:

- `AdminMovieController.php` - Movie CRUD operations
- `AdminSeriesController.php` - Series management
- `UserManagementController.php` - User administration
- `TMDBController.php` - TMDB data import and management

### Database Design

**Comprehensive Relationship Structure**:

- **Movies/Series**: Polymorphic relationships with genres, views, and sources
- **User Tracking**: Detailed view history, search history, and user action logs
- **Content Organization**: Genre categorization, quality levels, and source management
- **Analytics**: View counts, trending calculations, and user engagement metrics

### Frontend Architecture

**Blade + Alpine.js + Tailwind**: Modern frontend stack with component-based structure:

- **Tailwind CSS 4.x** for styling
- **Alpine.js 3.x** for interactive components
- **Vite** for asset compilation and hot reloading
- **Component Structure**: Reusable Blade components for consistent UI

### Security Implementation

**Multi-layer Security**:

- **Middleware**: `AdminMiddleware.php` for role-based access control
- **Rate Limiting**: Implemented on routes for API protection
- **CSRF Protection**: Laravel's built-in CSRF validation
- **Password Security**: Automatic password rehashing on login

### Search and Filtering

**Advanced Search System**:

- **Full-text Search**: Database full-text indexes on movie titles and descriptions
- **Filter Combinations**: Genre, year, quality, and rating filtering
- **Search History**: User search tracking and popular search analytics
- **Autocomplete**: Planned feature for search suggestions

## Important Implementation Notes

### TMDB API Integration
- API key stored in `.env` as `TMDB_API_KEY`
- Smart search detection: automatically detects if input is TMDB ID vs search query
- Supports both v3 and v4 TMDB API endpoints
- Error handling for API rate limits and connection issues

### Performance Considerations
- **N+1 Query Issues**: Some controllers need eager loading optimization
- **Caching Strategy**: Redis configuration present but not fully utilized
- **Database Indexing**: Comprehensive indexes on frequently queried columns

### Development Environment
- **Laragon Compatible**: Configured for Laragon local development
- **Database**: MySQL with empty password for local development
- **Queue System**: Database-driven queue system for background jobs

### File Structure Notes
- **Helpers**: Custom helper functions in `app/Helpers/helpers.php`
- **Migrations**: 35+ migration files with comprehensive database structure
- **Seeders**: Database seeders for initial data setup
- **Views**: Organized in admin/ and user-facing directories
